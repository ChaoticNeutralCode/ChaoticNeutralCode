title: My User Manual

A user manual provides an outline of how you operate and think. It allows everyone to gain an understanding of each other up front, from the start. The best, original, source I could find on the  how and why is [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaders-need-user-manuals-what-i-learned-writing-mine-abby-falik/). Check it out if you are curious for more information. 

Since I was asked to make one and enjoyed the concept I decided to publish it.

## My Style

* I learn much more through examples and experimentation rather than reading academic tomes on theories and concepts.

* I am apathetic about a lot of topics. I try to devote my mental energy to things I can control and are passionate about.

* My "social battery" gets filled quick when attending crowded social events. I prefer small group outings with people I know, or even just time to myself.

* I like to work in environments with high collaboration. I love to bounce ideas around with my teammates.

* I have never been a seeker of fame, fortune, or grandiose scales. I am fine working in the background, supporting the frontline.

## What I Value

* Being clear on what is expected of me.

* Asking for forgiveness rather than permission.

* Being curious.

* Giving credit/kudos where its due.

* Sharing your knowledge and experience with others.

## What I Donâ€™t Have Patience For

* People without passion. If you don't care, I will seek/focus on those who do.

* Judgemental attitudes. We all have flaws and quarks. Improvements come with time and patience, not condescending nagging.

* Being late. I plan my time practically and I expect those I work with to do the same.

* Unrealistic expectations. Requirements should be backed by evidence and cooperation, not siloed decisions from arrogant managers.

* Closed minds. There are always ways to improve and new things to learn.

## How Best to Communicate with Me

* Be forward with feedback. Don't worry about hurting my feelings or upsetting me. I never take it personally.

* I prefer to hear voices for important conversations, to eliminate lost nuance inherent in text communication.

* Its OK to just ask. You don't have to start with 5 minutes of pleasantries to get to asking for assistance.

## How to Help Me

* Don't correct me, convert me. Show me why your solution is better with facts, not with your resume.

* Toss ideas at me. I am always open to try new solutions.

* Don't remind me of the stakes. If we reviewed them earlier, I know the stakes.

* Call me out when I ramble or get off task. It happens and its usually not intentional.

## What People Misunderstand About Me

* I am constantly thinking about the next thing on my list. Sometimes this means I get ahead of myself.

* When I am serious my text chat style can be a little dry and forward. My intention can seem judgemental but I am not.

* My humor is not a defense mechanism. I honestly do enjoy quips and puns.
